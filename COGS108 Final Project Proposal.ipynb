    "With the upcoming presidential election, we wanted to try to develop a model which could attempt to predict the result. We specifically wanted to base our prediction on midterm election results and get some idea of how popular votes correlate to votes from the electoral college.  Though there are many iterations of prediction models for US presidential elections, many of these are based on factors such as consecutive terms in office for a certain party, presidential approval rate, unemployment rate, etc. whereas we would like to take a deeper look at how well the electoral college represents the popular vote as well as well as how the latter can predict the former. Additionally, while other models look at all states and their overall political leanings, our model focuses on voting outcomes within each state individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar study is described in an article from Texas Tech University called “A Bayesian Model for the Prediction of United States Presidential Elections” wherein data from poll data accessed through the various websites was used as the chief source to predict election results and had success in predicting electoral college results. This study had an average 95% accuracy rate for 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections. However, this model was unsuccessful in predicting 2016 election results according to the study because it failed to account for the date of polls and a lack of adapting to trends over time which could be a challenge in our own analysis as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In another study “Modeling and forecasting US presidential election using learning algorithms” stepwise regression testing was used to determine the significance of the following factors: the number of consecutive terms the incumbent party has been in office, personal income, electoral votes of the incumbent party in the previous election, votes of the incumbent party in the last senate election, votes of the incumbent party in the last house of representatives election, the president’s approval rate, unemployment rate and the number of times that the 3-month GDP is above 3.2 within the previous 4 years. Of these, all variables except the president’s job approval rate were omitted. Because many of the above factors did not pass significance testing, and the success of the previously mentioned study based on polling data, we think that our model has the potential to predict the 2020 presidential election.\n",

    "Yes, we do have permission to use our data. Since election data is freely and publicly available, we do have permission to use it.

    "Our data is election data, which is inherently biased. Not every citizen votes and so therefore, voting does not completely signify the political viewpoints of the entire country. In addition, there are certain aspects of voting that further prevent minority voters from the polls. This bias is definitely reflected in the outcome of elections. Our analysis cannot affect this bias and so it will be apparent in our analysis as well. These problems definitely impact the significance of our analysis, since we are attempting to see whether the electoral college’s voting patterns represent the voting patterns of midterm voters. However, since midterm voters are those who are more heavily involved in politics (and therefore most likely heavily represented in politics at large), the significance of our results will be affected. There is no way to completely handle this issue other than working to procure better voting regulations and have more people vote to begin with. However, we feel that noting the disparity amongst those who vote and those do not is an important step in analyzing our results (or our expected results). \n"
